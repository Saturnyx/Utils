from typing import Optional
import discord
from discord.ext import commands

async def clear_messages(
    ctx: commands.Context,
    amount: int,
    user: Optional[discord.Member] = None
) -> None:
    """
    Clear messages from a channel.

    Args:
        ctx: The command context
        amount: Number of messages to delete
        user: Optional user to filter messages by
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### Discord Bot Specific Guidelines
